Feature: Event time zones

	In order to display event dates to users in their local time zone
	As a system
	I need to record the time zone of the location in which an event occurred, along with the event time

	In order to know the location at which an event occurred
	As an administrator
	I need to be able to define the Location of each Scanner

	In order to know the time zone in which an event occurred
	As an administrator
	I need to be able to define a master set of Locations
	And I need to be able to define the Timezone of each Location

	In order to make the maintenance of locations easier
	As an administrator
	I need to be able to define a master set of countries
	And to define the time zone of that country
	And to define which locations are within each country
